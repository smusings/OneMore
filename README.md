OneMore is a counting app used to keep track of how many times a user has done a certain action, with room to keep track of up to six activities.

OneMore uses Fragments to display the information, and hide it accordingly as the user commands.

During development, OneMore used DialogFragments, Motion detection, and CustomArrays to display the information. However, the simplest way to display and modify the information was found to be a simple fragment containing a few buttons, a textview, and an edittext.
